**Cook Rotten Flesh into Leather in a more balanced way than a simple 1:1 conversion!**

### Why?
Although Rotten Flesh to Leather conversion packs are quite common, I felt like with the amount of Rotten Flesh you generally get in survival a simple 1 to 1 conversion is quite unbalanced. I like that it gives Rotten Flesh more of a use, but it makes Leather too easy to get in my opinion. Hence this pack.

### How does it work?
By default this datapack allows you to cook Rotten Flesh on a Soul Campfire just like regular raw meat and get Leather in return! With the default settings a regular campfire won't accept the rotten flesh as I wanted a bit more balancing than just a raw chance, as it forces the player to at least venture into the Nether to get some soul sand.

You can change whether a campfire cooks rotten flesh or not by using `/function #rme:campfire_leather/toggle_campfire` and `/function #rme:campfire_leather/toggle_soul_campfire` respectively. Adjust it to your needs!

The Rotten Flesh has a 20% chance of being converted to Leather, if it doesn't it just burns up. Because of this Rotten Flesh has more uses, especially early to mid game, and you can also easily dispose of your Rotten Flesh while getting some leather in return!

**PSA: The current Version works only on 1.20.x, if people want this for 1.19.x or lower just let me know through the issues page!**

***Since this is my first datapack I am sure it's not very optimised, feel free to give feedback ^^***
